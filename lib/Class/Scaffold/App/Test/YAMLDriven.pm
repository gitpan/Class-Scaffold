                # There seems to be a difference in the behaviour of YAML and
                # YAML::XS when it comes to wide characters. YAML::Load()
                # wants the string to be a perl wide character string whereas
                # YAML::XS::Load() wants a string of bytes which it tries to
                # utf-8 decode afterwards.
                #
                # This is a problem in Class::Scaffold::App::Test::YAMLDriven
                # because it uses both of the two YAML modules. So if we're
                # writing our tests with the use_yaml_active tag, we can
                # include utf-8 in the document. But if we instead use YAML
                # with the marshall classes, we cannot use utf-8 directly.
