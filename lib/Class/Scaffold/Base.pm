=head1 NAME

Class::Scaffold::Base - Base class for all classes of the class framework.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.101400

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for all classes of the class framework. Everything
should subclass this.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_autoloaded_package

This class method takes a single prefix and adds it to the list - set, really
- of packages whose methods should be autoloaded. The L<Class::Scaffold>
framework will typically be used by an application whose classes are stored in
and underneath a package namespace. To avoid having to load all classes
explicitly, you can pass the namespace to this method. This class defines a
L<UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD> that respects the set of classes it should autoload
methods for.

=head2 FIRST_CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS

This method is used by the constructor to order key-value pairs that are
passed to the newly created object's accessors - see
L<Class::Accessor::Constructor>. This class just defines it as an empty list;
subclasses should override it as necessary. The method exists in this class so
even if subclasses don't override it, there's something for the constructor
mechanism to work with.

=head2 MUNGE_CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS

This method is used by the constructor to munge the constructor arguments -
see L<Class::Accessor::Constructor>. This class' method just returns the
arguments as is; subclasses should override it as necessary. The method exists
in this class so even if subclasses don't override it, there's something for
the constructor mechanism to work with.

=head2 init

This method is called at the end of the constructor - see
L<Class::Accessor::Constructor>. This class' method does nothing; subclasses
should override it and wrap it with C<SUPER::> as necessary. The method exists
in this class so even if subclasses don't override it, there's something for
the constructor mechanism to work with.

=head2 log

This method acts as a shortcut to L<Class::Scaffold::Log>. Instead of writing

    use Class::Scaffold::Log;
    Class::Scaffold::Log->instance->debug('foo');

you can simply write

    $self->log->debug('foo');
