    # For each requested symbol, install a proxy sub into the caller's
    # namespace. When invoked, it will get the caller's $self and retrieve the
    # symbol's value from the caller's delegate. It will then replace itself
    # with a sub that just returns that value.
    #
    # The value is cached so that if the same constant is imported in
    # different packages we still only make one call to the delegate.
    #
    # That way the symbol can be used without the $self->delegate->... part.
    # You have to make sure that when the symbol is first used, you do it from
    # within a method whose $self has access to the delegate.
    #
    # The delegate is cached so that later this mechanism can be used even
    # from within subs that don't have access to the delegate.
