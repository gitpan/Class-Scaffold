# ABSTRACT: Base class for all framework classes that support a storage.
use parent 'Class::Scaffold::Base';
__PACKAGE__->mk_scalar_accessors(qw(storage_type))
  ->mk_hash_accessors(qw(storage_info));

# Don't store the storage object itself, store the method we need to call on
# the delegate to get the storage object. This is just a little overhead, but
# saves us from a lot of headache when serializing and deserializing objects
# with Storable's freeze() and thaw(), because storage objects can't be
# deserialized properly.
#
# Impose a certain order on how the constructor args are processed. We want
# the storage to be set first, because other properties could be defined using
# mk_framework_object_accessors(). Now if the args were set in an arbitrary
# order, the framework_object-properties could be processed before the storage
# is set, which would cause an error, because the storage wouldn't be set yet,
# so it can't be asked to make an object.
#
# We can't have storage_type as a key within the storage_info hash, because we
# want to be able to set it directly if passed as an argument to the
# constructor; we also need to be able to prefer it in
# Class::Scaffold::Storable::FIRST_CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS().
#
# We use the storage's signature as the id key, i.e. to find the id of the
# object within the storage. It would not be sufficient to use the storage's
# package name as the hash key because we can think of a multiplex storage
# that multiplexes onto two file system paths. In that case each of the
# multiplexed storages would have the same package name. And we can't use the
# storage's memory address (0x012345678) because different stages can be run
# within different processes and on different machines.
#
# For example, the attributes of an object of this class might look like:
# storage_type: core_storage
# storage_info:
#   id:
#     'Registry::NICAT::Storage::DBI::Oracle::NICAT,dbname=db.test,dbuser=nic': id12345
#     'Some::File::Storage,fspath=/path/to/storage/root': id45678
# This example assumes that the core storage is multiplexing on a DBI storage
# and a file system storage.
