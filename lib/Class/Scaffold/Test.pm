# Also inherit from Class::Scaffold::Base so we get a delegate; put it first
# so its new() is found, not the very basic new() from Project::Build::Test

# Override planned_test_count() with a version that uses every_list().
# Project::Build::Test->planned_test_count() couldn't use that because
# every_list() is implemented in Data::Inherited, which in turn uses
# Project::Build.
